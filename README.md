🎯 How to Play

Player 1 is Cross (X) 🔴

Player 2 is Circle (O) 🔵

Players take turns clicking on boxes.

First to align 3 symbols vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins.

If all 9 boxes are filled with no winner → It’s a Draw!

📱 Responsiveness

Mobile (≤480px) → compact layout, stacked players.

Tablet → medium grid size, balanced spacing.

Desktop → larger grid, maximum box size capped.

Uses CSS clamp() + aspect-ratio for fluid scaling.

🔮 Future Improvements

Add single-player mode with basic AI.

Animate winning combinations.

Add score tracking across multiple rounds.
